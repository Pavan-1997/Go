# Go

Go is a general-purpose language designed with systems programming in mind. It was initially developed at Google in the year 2007 by Robert Griesemer, Rob Pike, and Ken Thompson. It is strongly and statically typed, provides inbuilt support for garbage collection, and supports concurrent programming.

Go programming implementations use a traditional compile and link model to generate executable binaries.

The Go programming language was announced in November 2009 and is used in some of the Google's production systems.
